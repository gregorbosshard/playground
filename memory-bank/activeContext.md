# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initialization phase. We have:

- Created the Memory Bank structure to document the project
- Identified the core requirements from the README.md

## Recent Changes

- Initialized the Memory Bank with six core files based on the project requirements
- Documented the project scope and technical requirements

## Next Steps

1. Create the basic ASP.NET Core Empty project with .NET 8.0
2. Set up Serilog integration for logging
3. Implement multi-tenant support using CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy following these steps:
   - Define application-specific tenant class
   - Configure tenants in application settings
   - Integrate multi-tenant middleware in startup

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Need to determine the specific Serilog sinks to be used (Console is a minimum)
- Need to decide on the tenant identification strategy (hostname, header, etc.)
- Consider how tenant-specific configuration will be structured
- Determine logging enrichment strategy to include tenant information in logs

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Following ASP.NET Core best practices for middleware integration
- Using dependency injection for all services
- Structured logging with contextual information
- Clean separation between multi-tenant concerns and application logic

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project serves as a learning platform for ASP.NET Core 8.0
- Multi-tenant implementation will demonstrate isolation patterns
- Serilog integration will showcase structured logging best practices

## Current Challenges

- Need to understand the specific requirements of the CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy library
- Determine the appropriate level of logging detail
- Design the tenant resolution strategy that best fits the application needs
