# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project has progressed from the initialization phase to implementation. We have:

- Created the Memory Bank structure to document the project
- Implemented the ASP.NET Core Empty project (issue #9)
- Created GitHub issues for all core requirements
- Created a pull request for the ASP.NET Core Empty project implementation

## Recent Changes

- Created three GitHub issues (#9, #10, #11) for the core requirements
- Implemented ASP.NET Core Empty project with .NET 9.0 (instead of 8.0 due to SDK availability)
- Enhanced HTTP pipeline with proper middleware configuration
- Added health check endpoint and info endpoint
- Created comprehensive README.md with documentation
- Created PR #12 to merge the ASP.NET Core Empty project implementation

## Next Steps

1. Merge PR #12 for the ASP.NET Core Empty project
2. Implement Serilog integration for logging (issue #10):
   - Add Serilog NuGet packages
   - Configure Serilog in Program.cs
   - Set up appropriate log sinks
   - Configure log enrichment
3. Implement multi-tenant support using CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy (issue #11)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Using .NET 9.0 instead of .NET 8.0 due to SDK availability on the development system
- Need to determine the specific Serilog sinks to be used (Console is a minimum)
- Need to decide on the tenant identification strategy (hostname, header, etc.)
- Consider how tenant-specific configuration will be structured
- Determine logging enrichment strategy to include tenant information in logs

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Following ASP.NET Core best practices for middleware integration
- Using dependency injection for all services
- Structured logging with contextual information
- Clean separation between multi-tenant concerns and application logic
- Following git branch naming convention: `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
- Following git commit message format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project serves as a learning platform for ASP.NET Core
- Multi-tenant implementation will demonstrate isolation patterns
- Serilog integration will showcase structured logging best practices
- Health checks provide a simple way to monitor application status

## Current Challenges

- Need to understand the specific requirements of the CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy library
- Determine the appropriate level of logging detail
- Design the tenant resolution strategy that best fits the application needs
