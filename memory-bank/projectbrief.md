# Project Brief

## Project Overview

This is a playground project for building a new ASP.NET Service with .NET 8.0. The project serves as an example implementation with specific features focused on modern ASP.NET development practices.

## Core Requirements

1. Create an empty ASP.NET project using the "ASP.NET Core Empty" template
2. Integrate logging functionality using Serilog
3. Implement multi-tenant support using CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate the setup of a modern ASP.NET Core application
- Showcase proper integration of logging services using Serilog
- Implement a robust multi-tenant architecture using the CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy library
- Serve as a reference implementation for future ASP.NET Core projects

## Project Scope

The project is limited to implementing the core features mentioned above and does not include additional functionality beyond these requirements. It is intended as a demonstration and learning tool rather than a production application.

## Success Criteria

- Functional ASP.NET Core application with .NET 8.0
- Properly configured Serilog logging
- Working multi-tenant implementation following the CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy guidelines
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Comprehensive documentation
