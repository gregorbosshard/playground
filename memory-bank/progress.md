# Progress

## What Works

- Memory Bank initialization is complete with all six core files created
- ASP.NET Core Empty project has been implemented with the following features:
  - Created with .NET 9.0 (instead of 8.0 due to SDK availability)
  - Enhanced HTTP pipeline with proper middleware configuration
  - Health check endpoint for monitoring application status
  - Info endpoint providing application details
  - Comprehensive README.md with documentation
- GitHub issues created for all core requirements (#9, #10, #11)
- Pull request #12 created for the ASP.NET Core Empty project implementation

## What's Left to Build

1. **ASP.NET Core Empty Project**
   - Create the basic project structure using the "ASP.NET Core Empty" template
   - Set up the initial Program.cs file
   - Configure basic HTTP pipeline
   - Add health check endpoint
   - Add info endpoint

2. **Serilog Integration**

   - Add Serilog NuGet packages
   - Configure Serilog in Program.cs
   - Set up appropriate log sinks
   - Configure log enrichment

3. **Multi-Tenant Support**
   - Add CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy package
   - Define application-specific tenant class
   - Configure tenants in appsettings.json
   - Implement tenant resolution strategy
   - Add multi-tenant middleware to the HTTP pipeline
   - Test tenant isolation

## Current Status

- ASP.NET Core Empty project implementation is complete
- Pull request #12 is awaiting review and merge
- Ready to begin implementation of Serilog integration (issue #10)

## Known Issues

- Using .NET 9.0 instead of the originally specified .NET 8.0 due to SDK availability on the development system

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial project scope defined in README.md
- Decision to use Memory Bank for comprehensive documentation
- Created GitHub issues for all core requirements
- Implemented ASP.NET Core Empty project with .NET 9.0 instead of .NET 8.0
- Enhanced HTTP pipeline with additional endpoints for better testability
- Following git workflow with feature branches and pull requests

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Merge PR #12 for the ASP.NET Core Empty project
2. Create branch for issue #10 (Serilog integration)
3. Add Serilog NuGet packages
4. Configure Serilog in Program.cs
