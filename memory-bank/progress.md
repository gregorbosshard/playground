# Progress

## What Works

- Memory Bank initialization is complete with all six core files created

## What's Left to Build

1. **ASP.NET Core Empty Project**

   - Create the basic project structure using the "ASP.NET Core Empty" template
   - Set up the initial Program.cs file
   - Configure basic HTTP pipeline

2. **Serilog Integration**

   - Add Serilog NuGet packages
   - Configure Serilog in Program.cs
   - Set up appropriate log sinks
   - Configure log enrichment

3. **Multi-Tenant Support**
   - Add CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy package
   - Define application-specific tenant class
   - Configure tenants in appsettings.json
   - Implement tenant resolution strategy
   - Add multi-tenant middleware to the HTTP pipeline
   - Test tenant isolation

## Current Status

- Project is in the initialization phase
- Memory Bank documentation is complete
- Ready to begin implementation of core features

## Known Issues

- None at this stage, as implementation has not yet begun

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial project scope defined in README.md
- Decision to use Memory Bank for comprehensive documentation
- Structured approach to implementing the three main features:
  1. ASP.NET Core Empty project
  2. Serilog integration
  3. Multi-tenant support with CMI.Infrastructure.MultiTenancy

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Create the ASP.NET Core Empty project
2. Add initial NuGet packages
3. Set up basic project structure
4. Begin Serilog integration
