# Windsurf's Memory Bank

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

## Core Workflows

### Chat Mode

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}

    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]

    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
```

### Write Mode

```mermaid

    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]
```

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:

1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]

    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process
```

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

# Function Map

The system operates through a well-defined function map that serves as a software layer within the model context:

```xml
<FunctionMap>
  <!-- GitHub Functions -->
  <GitHubFunctions>
    <Function id="createIssue">Create a new issue in this repository. The description must follow the template issue-template.md.</Function>
    <Function id="commitChanges">Commit changes to this repository. With the message these following the rules from git-rules.md.</Function>
    <Function id="createBranch">Create a new branch in this repository. With branch name following the rules from git-rules.md.</Function>
    <Function id="createPR">Create a new pull request in this repository. With an exact summary of the changes made.</Function>
  </GitHubFunctions>
</FunctionMap>
```
